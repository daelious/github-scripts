An assortment of GitHub related scripts for general maintenance and such.


## Future Enhancement Ideas
### `github-tag-clean.sh`
* Utilize `curl` and GitHub [REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)/[GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)s to more efficiently gather the tags then clone only when we are actually going to do the removals. (Would need to investigate further to find if we can get all info needed.)
